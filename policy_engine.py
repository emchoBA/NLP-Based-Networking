Takes a natural-language policy string, parses it via enhanced NLP
(handling 1 or 2 IPs to determine subject and target device),
maps verbs to correct iptables targets (ACCEPT/DROP),
determines direction (INPUT/OUTPUT, -s/-d) based on subject IP's context,
and pushes commands to the correct TARGET Pi over TCP (via admin_connect).
